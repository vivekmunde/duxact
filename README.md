# Duxact: React + Redux with Actions as the Reducers

Application state management for [React]([https://reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/) inspired by the [Redux](https://redux.js.org) & [React-Redux](https://react-redux.js.org).

 - Action is the Reducer
 - No need to define the Reducers separately and then combine them into one
 - No more Switch Cases

*Work Under Progress*
